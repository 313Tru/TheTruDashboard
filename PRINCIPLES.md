# TruDashboard Development Principles

This document outlines the core, unchangeable rules that govern the development and use of the TruDashboard tool. These principles ensure the tool remains safe, fair, and true to its original purpose.

---

### 1. No Hardcoded API Keys

**Rule:** No API Key will ever be stored or hardcoded directly within the script's source code. The application is designed to only use keys provided by the end-user, which are stored exclusively on their local device (e.g., in browser `localStorage`). This maintains a strict separation between the application's code and user-specific data.

### 2. Non-Commercial Use Only

**Rule:** This script will never be used for commercial purposes. It will not be sold, licensed, or exchanged for any form of currency, whether real-world money or in-game assets. It is a tool built by a fan, for fans.

### 3. Private, Friends-Only Access

**Rule:** Access to and use of this tool is intended for a small, private circle of friends (less than 10 people). It is not meant for public distribution.

### 4. User-Provided Keys

**Rule:** The tool is designed with the expectation that users will only provide their own personal API keys to access their own data. This is a community tool built on trust within our friendly friend group.
